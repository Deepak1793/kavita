Problem solving tools and techniques
------------------------------------ 
- Algorithm
- Flowchart

Advantages
------------
  neutral solution
- provide a generic solution for the problems
- these generic solutions can be implemented with different technology

Algorithm
---------- 
- Basic english text representation of solution
- step by step process to find a final solution
- english description of a solution
- The algorithm written by one person may differ from other person


Algorithm to withdraw money from ATM machine

Step 0:start
step 1:insert the debit card into ATM machine
step 2:Read the instructions
step 3: enter the ammount to be withdrawn
step 4: enter PIN 
step 5: collect the cash
step 6: collect the card
step 7: collect the receipt
step 8: stop /end


adding -ve scenarios

Step 0:start
step 1:insert the debit card into ATM machine
        step 1.1:if the card is detected goto step 2
        step 1.2:(card is not detecting)else goto step1
step 2: Read the instructions
step 3: enter the amount to be withdrawn
        step 3.1: if the amount to correct(proper amount in whole no)
        step 3.2: else goto step3 
step 4: enter PIN 
         step 4.1: if the PIN entered is wrong , display "incorrect PIN" and goto step 4
         step 4.2: if customer have insufficient balance/limit exceeds/machine doesnot have sufficient cash , display "enter correct amount"
         step 4.3: else goto step5
step 5: collect the cash
step 6: collect the card
step 7: collect the receipt
step 8: stop /end



Task:
1.Write the complete algorithm to deposit money into the cash deposit machine
2.wite the complete algorithm to apply for Housing loan in your bank
3.wite the complete algorithm to open a bank account (savings)
4.wite the complete algorithm to apply PASSPORT
5.wite the complete algorithm to display total loan amount, by inputing the tenure and rate of interest



Alogorithm to add 2 numbers
step 0: start
step 1:input 2 numbers
step 2: calculate the sum of 2 numbers
step 3: Display the sum
step 4: stop


Algorithm to check the eligibility to open the savings account for Indian person
step 0:start
step 1:input the age
step 2: store age "customer_age" 
step 3: check if "customer_age"  >=18
       step 3.1: Then display "You are eligible to open account" and goto step 4
       step 3.2: else("customer_age"  <=18) display "You are eligible to open account" and goto step 4
step 4: end/stop
